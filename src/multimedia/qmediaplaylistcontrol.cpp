    \brief The QMediaPlaylistControl class provides access to the playlist
    functionality of a QMediaService.

    If a QMediaService contains an internal playlist it will implement
    QMediaPlaylistControl.  This control provides access to the contents of the
    \l {playlistProvider()}{playlist}, as well as the \l
    {currentIndex()}{position} of the current media, and a means of navigating
    to the \l {next()}{next} and \l {previous()}{previous} media.

    The functionality provided by the control is exposed to application code
    through the QMediaPlaylist class.

    The interface name of QMediaPlaylistControl is \c com.nokia.Qt.QMediaPlaylistControl/1.0 as
    defined in QMediaPlaylistControl_iid.
